# 🧠 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is part of my CodeAlpha internship. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease using clinical data.

---

## 📌 Objective
Predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on medical parameters.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)
- Contains patient health metrics like age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, etc.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost Classifier
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for web app)

---

## 🧠 Model
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Classifier
- **Accuracy Achieved**: ~82%

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature scaling and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Interactive Streamlit app for user input and predictions
